                <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

                <p class="my-paras">Hello my people, this is my website where i will have some relevant and unrelevant
                    info about myself. I will also keep links to cool projects that i will develope on here. This
                    website also acts as an experimental tool for me to try new things in web design. </p>

                <p class="my-paras"> here on the home page you can find cool pictures of me and perhaps if you are lucky
                    you can find a
                    secret easter egg here one day who knows.</p>

                <p class="my-paras">on the info page i will have info on me and i may implement a log in on there to
                    gain access to my cool info</p>
                <p class="my-paras">on the contact page you can find ways in which you might contact me, the actual
                    reality of the matter is that i am actually near impossible to reach unless you have my cool phone
                    number which you will only be able to get by logging in </p>

                <p class="my-paras">on the project page i will keep stuff about the projects i have worked on, there i
                    will also query you on basis of my most recent project which is gathering your info and data which i
                    will then sell for a hefty sum. Nom Nom Nom i love that data.</p>
